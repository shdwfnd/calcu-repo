# Project Requirements
• Create a group composed of 4-5 people from your section. Each individual should only belong to one group.

• Develop a calculator in Python with a graphical user interface (UI).

• The calculator must have the following simple functions:

– Numeric keypad (0-9) with decimal point

– Can perform addition (+) , subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (%).

– Your calculator should be capable of chaining multiple operations together and it must execute them in the correct order.

∗ The basic requirements that does not require you to implement parentheses in your operations.

– A delete button that deletes one character at a time

– A clear button that deletes everything that is written on the screen

– You can also include other functionalities that you see fit as long as you fulfill the basic requirements stated above.

• Create a github repository that will host your project. This github repos�itory must be public.

• All members must commit to this repository. Members with no commits will automatically get zero. Wag po tayong pabuhat.

• Setting up your projet should be done in one step only, particulary, by running: pip install -r requirements.txt

• Running your project should also be done in one step only: python main.py

• I also expect that you will be writing tests for the project. I should be able to run these tests using one command only: python test.py

• A 2-3 minute video (by group) that documents what you have done in this project.

## GIT

Since we will be using Github, let us take advantage of the optimizations it introduces on our workflow. • Your project should have a minimum of 3 branches. – The main development branch – Branch for developing the calculator logic. – Brach for developing the UI. Depending on how you divide the tasks, your repository can have more branches. • You can use Github’s issues feature to act as a checklist/project manage�ment tool. You can create individual issues to signify each feature that you want to implement for the project. • Add a README.md file in the root directory of your repository.

Dividing Tasks

Let’s assume a group of 4 people. With object oriented-programming, we can easily separate the logic of the calculator from it’s user facing component which is the UI. • One person will act as the team leader. He will manage the github repos�itory, write some unit tests, and be the one in charged with integrating the calculator logic with the UI. Also, this person must be knowledgeable in merging different git branches together. • The other one will be in charged of writing the calculator logic. He can also participate in writing the unit tests to assure that the calculator logic is working well. • The third person will be the one assigned in doing the UI. Python has a lot if available packages that can be used in developing UI components. It is the job of this team member to determine what library will best suit this application. He/she can also write some unit tests to assured UI components are behaving as desired. • The last member will be in charged with the documentation and should be the one in charged in writing the majority of the unit tests.
